## v0.2.12 - June 2nd 2019

## v0.2.11 - May 24th 2019

* Update replay parser to be compatible with more replays

## v0.2.10 - April 25th 2019

* Serialize 64bit numbers as strings, so that JSON parsers don't lose any data
  in parsing them as 64bit floating point
  * Javascript numbers are 64bit floating point. 64bit integers can't be
    represented wholly in floating point notation. Thus serialize them as
    strings so that downstream applications can decide on how best to interpret
    large numbers (like 76561198122624102). Affects Int64, QWord, Steam, and
    XBox attributes.
* QWord header property changes from i64 to u64 as some pointed out that
  negative numbers didn't make sense for QWord properties (OnlineId)

* Add a `--dry-run` option that won't output JSON
* Update replay parser to support current replays

## v0.2.2 - February 14th, 2018

* Fixed several bugs surrounding parsing of the network data. More replays are now parseable

## v0.2.1 - February 1st, 2018

* If a directory argument is provided, the top level is searched for any `*.replay` files. This works around issues when the shell
  expands the glob to too many files and makes it easier to work with on Windows (which does not expand globs).

## v0.2.0 - January 31st, 2018

* Process replays in parallel using the `-m` option
* Add rudimentary network data parser. Since it's not surefire, it's not enabled by default.
* Support an older replay format

## v0.1.0 - October 26th, 2017

* Initial release
